# VALO
A slowly improving Python-based crypto-currency.

## Contributing
There are two kinds of contributions possible to this project, as donations are not
accepted.\
The first and less technical way is to get creative and submit ideas for future
improvements in the form of an [issue](https://gitlab.com/ClashLuke/valo/-/issues/new)
or an [email](mailto:lucasnestler@web.de). Duplicates will be closed and linked to a main
thread, there is no action required on your part. Anything is possible.\
The second would be to look through current to-do's and start implementing one on a
fork.
